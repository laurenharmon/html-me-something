    <p>Recently, I was listening to an audiobook called Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer. In an early chapter, she describes how trees communicate through their root systems to mass fruit at the same time. This really interested me, so I did some further research. This webpage is dedicated to that strange, interesting, truly awesome information.</p>
