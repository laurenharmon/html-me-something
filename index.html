       <h1>Welcome to My Graded Assignment About Tree Communication.</h1>
       <h3>(I mean...that's cool, right?)</h3>
        <p>Recently, I was listening to an audiobook called <i>Braiding Sweetgrass</i> by Robin Wall Kimmerer. In an early chapter, she describes how trees communicate through their root systems to mass fruit at the same time. This really interested me, so I did some further research. This webpage is dedicated to that strange, interesting, truly awesome information.</p>

      <p>In one <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-whispering-trees-180968084/">Smithosonian article</a>, a scientist describes the network between trees. "All the trees [in this foreset], and in every forest that is not too damaged, are connected to each other through underground fungal networks. Trees share water and nutrients through the networks, and also use them to communicate. They send distress signals about drought and disease, for example, or insect attacks, and other trees alter their behavior when they receive these messages.‚Äù  In exchange for connecting the trees, these fungi consume <b>30 percent</b> of the sugar photosynthesized by the tree.</p>
      <p>Trees can communicate through the air, as well. One example is the umbrella thorn acacia from sub-Saharan Africa (pictured below). If this tree detects damage to its leaves caused by a munching giraffe, it will emit ethylene gas into the air. When the surrounding acacias sense this distress signal, they will push tannins into their leaves. In high enough quantities, these tannins can sicken or kill a giraffe that tries to have a little acacia leaf snack.</p>
